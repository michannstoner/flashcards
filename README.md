## FlashCards 

A solo project by [Michann Stoner](https://github.com/michannstoner).

### Description 

FlashCards is a 'game' that is fully playable through the command line!ðŸ˜¯  It is intended to simulate a set of flash cards, where the user is able to see questions, guess the answer, find out if they were correct or not, and see a final score at the end of the round. Use it to study, to have fun trivia nights, or see how well you and your friends know each other! 

### How To Play

-Run `node index.js` in your command line 

-See your first question, and a list of possible answers

-Use your up/down arrows on your keyboard to choose which answer you think is correct

-Press enter!

-Get feedback on whether you're correct or not

-Press enter for your next question, and continue until your round is over

### Project Wins & Challenges 

##### Wins 
I feel like I thoroughly enjoyed this project, even in the difficult moments. I had a lot of 'lightbulb' moments when writing tests, that solidified techniques for writing cleaner implementation code. I feel like this tied up some previous loose ends, and I had a lot of fun with it! 

##### Challenges 
There was a lot of class to class interaction in this project, which previously felt like a very weak area for me. Admittedly, it was still challenging in this project, having multiple classes that are dependent on each other. I feel proud for not getting too discouraged though and for feeling like I truly learned a lot from the project.
