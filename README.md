## FlashCards 

A solo project by [Michann Stoner](https://github.com/michannstoner).

### Description 

FlashCards is a 'game' that is fully playable through the command line! It is intended to simulate a set of flash cards, where the user is able to see questions, guess the answer, find out if they were correct or not, and see a final score at the end of the round. Use it to study, to have fun trivia nights, or see how well your friends know you!
